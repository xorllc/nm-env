The key here turned out to be the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. This was empty on a standard shell session on my system.

There seem to be lots of directories with pkgconfig in the name, but to find the correct one I was able to use apt-file per this thread i.e.

$ apt-file search fontconfig.pc
libfontconfig1-dev: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/fontconfig.pc

Then run

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig

And now the ./configure step can find the .pc file which it requires for that library. Learning about apt-file seems to be a useful outcome of this problem.
